# Known Problem/Incompatibilities

well for now there's only one significant problem and it's cyrillic support with ModernUI,
if you didn't like smooth font you can turn it off by going to Ctrl/⌘+K>Preferences>Text Layout>Default Font Beahvoir and set it to **Keep All**, but then cyrillic text would be looking like empty space, so the only to ways to fix it is:
1. stay with the smooth font
2. disable new text engine by going to Ctrl/⌘+K>Preferences>Extensions>Modern Text Engine set to off, but then things like emojis and markdown not going to work
