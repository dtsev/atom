# Installation⏬

To install atom for now you can only [download it from modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/atommodpack)

# Known Problems/Incompatibilities🧱

well for now there's only one significant problem at the moment, and that's the Cyrillic support in ModernUI,
If you don't like the smooth font, you can disable it by going to Ctrl/⌘+K>Preferences>Text Layout>Default Font Behavior and set **Keep All**, but then the Cyrillic text will look like empty space, so the only way to fix it is as follows:
1. stay with the smooth font
2. disable the new text engine by going to Ctrl/⌘+K>Options>Extensions>Modern Text Engine and disabling it, but then things like emoji and markup won't work
